# Vercel Web Analytics Integration

## Summary
Successfully integrated Vercel Web Analytics into the React + Vite frontend application to track visitor data and page views.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation
- Installed `@vercel/analytics` package via npm
- Updated `package-lock.json` with new dependency

### 2. Component Integration
**Modified File:** `frontend/src/App.tsx`

Added Vercel Analytics integration to the main App component:
- Imported `Analytics` component from `@vercel/analytics/react`
- Placed the `<Analytics />` component at the root level of the application
- This placement ensures analytics tracking applies to all pages and routes in the application

## Implementation Details

The project is a React application using:
- **Framework:** React 19.2.0
- **Build Tool:** Vite 7.2.2
- **Routing:** React Router DOM 7.9.5
- **UI Components:** HeroUI, Tailwind CSS

For React applications without Next.js, the Vercel documentation recommends using the plain React implementation (`@vercel/analytics/react`), which is what was implemented. This provides web analytics tracking without route-specific support (which is automatic with React Router).

## Next Steps for Deployment

After deploying to Vercel:
1. Enable Web Analytics in the Vercel dashboard (Analytics tab)
2. The application will automatically track:
   - Visitor data
   - Page views and interactions
   - Performance metrics

3. Once enabled and deployed, users can view analytics data at:
   - Vercel Dashboard → Project → Analytics tab

## Build & Verification

✅ Build completed successfully with no errors
✅ Linting passed (no new errors introduced)
✅ Package installation completed
✅ Code follows existing project patterns and conventions

## Technical Notes

- The `Analytics` component is lightweight and non-blocking
- Tracking data is sent via `/_vercel/insights/view` endpoints
- No route-specific support is available with the plain React implementation, but all page transitions tracked through React Router will still be captured
- Works seamlessly with the existing HeroUI and Tailwind CSS setup
